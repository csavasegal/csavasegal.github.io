title: About me

<!-- How do our past experiences inform how we process new information? How do individuals reach different interpretations of the exact same experience?  -->
I'm a Cognitive Neuroscience PhD candidate advised by Emily Finn at Dartmouth College. I work in the [Functional Imaging and Naturalistic Neuroscience Lab](https://thefinnlab.github.io/research/).

Using a combination of neuroimaging and behavioral methods, I'm interested in how we integrate incoming information with existent knowledge and how this may differ meaningfully at the individual level.  Currently, I am funded by the NSF GRFP. I got my Bachelor's from the University of Chicago where I completed my thesis with <a href="http://casasanto.com/" style="color: grey">Daniel Casasanto</a> and also was an undergraduate RA in <a href="https://voices.uchicago.edu/gomezlab/" style="color: grey">Christopher Gomez's lab</a> and in the <a href="https://awhvogellab.com/" style="color: grey">Awh-Vogel Lab</a>. I then worked as a lab manager/research assistant at Stanford in <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/parvizi-lab.html" style="color: grey">Josef Parvizi's lab</a>.

I also am interested in science communication and public education. Prior to graduate school, I did some medical editing and informally worked in classrooms (specifically, Pre-K and 12th grade, so I got both crazy ends of the K-12 system). Most recently, I've been teaching extended learning classes which I've been really enjoying!

<!-- One of the questions I've been exploring is how we reach variable interpretations of the same experience - I'm interested in measuring endogenous individual variability in neural activity and its subsequent effects on behavior, and in experimentally manipulating context to understand how this variability arises "naturally".  -->
