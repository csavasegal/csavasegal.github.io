        <p> 

            How do our past experiences inform how we process new information? How do individuals reach different interpretations of the exact same experience? Using a combination of neuroimaging and behavioral methods, I'm 
            interested in how we integrate incoming information with existent knowledge and how this may differ meaningfully at the 
            individual level. 
            <!-- One of the questions I've been exploring is how we reach variable interpretations of the same experience - I'm interested in 
            measuring endogenous individual variability in neural activity and its subsequent effects 
            on behavior, and in experimentally manipulating context to understand how this variability arises "naturally".             -->
    
            </p>
    
            <p>I got my Bachelor's from the University of Chicago where I completed my thesis with <a href = "http://casasanto.com/" style="color: grey">Daniel Casasanto</a> 
                and also was an undergraduate RA in <a href = "https://voices.uchicago.edu/gomezlab/" style="color: grey" > Christopher Gomez's lab</a> and in the <a href = "https://awhvogellab.com/"style="color: grey"  >Awh-Vogel Lab</a>. 
                I then worked as a lab manager/research assistant at Stanford in <a href = "https://med.stanford.edu/parvizi-lab.html" style="color: grey" > Josef Parvizi's lab</a>. </p>
        
        
            <p> I also am interested in science communication and public education. Prior to graduate school, I did some medical editing and worked in classrooms (specifically, Pre-K and 12th grade, so I got both crazy ends of the K-12 system). 
                Most recently, I've been teaching extended learning classes which I've been really enjoying!</a></p>

            <!-- I use a combination of neuroimaging and behavior to explore questions such as <strong>how</strong> can individuals with a shared experience 
            reach variable memories, conclusions or interpretations about the exact same events.
            
            I'm also interested in other relevant questions like: 
    
            <ol>
                <p>What is the interaction between past knowledge/memories and incoming sensory information?</p>
                <p>How do we integrate incoming information with our existent knowledge?</p>
                <p>What are the neural dynamics and patterns supporting encoding and recall, and how are these modified and updated with impression changes?</p>
                <p>How can we identify meaningful individual variability?</p>
                <p>How can we experimentally manipulate or perturb these processes?</p>
            </ol> -->
