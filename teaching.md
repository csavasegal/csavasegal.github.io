Prior to starting graduate school, I considered a career in education policy and science communication, both of which inform how I think about teaching and research today. These interests started as an undergrad when I applied for the UChicago Careers in Education Program and <a href="https://voices.uchicago.edu/successfulpathways/milgrom-community-service-and-innovation-fellowship/"> Milgrom Education Impact Fellowship</a>, which were probably the best choices I made in college. I wound up spending a lot of time working in public schools in different forms (pre-K and high school). 
After college, I had the opportunity to teach after-school neuroscience classes, to mentor high schoolers and college students, and, in what feels like another life, create content for neuroscience comic books and an iOS high-school science app. 

Programs that I've worked with that I highly recommend include: <a href="https://www.project-short.com/"> Project SHORT</a>, <a href="https://www.skypeascientist.com/"> Skype a Scientist</a>, <a href= "https://imentor.org/where-we-work/bay-area?gclid=CjwKCAiA4smsBhAEEiwAO6DEjd9mSDIkCQNpaC4q7yf7C9YQeK6SdkQofWxSGqeYRzmLgP4sYiJZTxoCMPkQAvD_BwE"> iMentor</a>, <a href="https://www.jstart.org/">Jumpstart</a>, and <a href="https://splashchicago.learningu.org/teach/teachers/clarasavasegal/bio.html">Splash</a>. Feel free to reach out with questions about any of these.
