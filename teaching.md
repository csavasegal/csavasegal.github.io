  <h2 class="section-header">Teaching Philosophy & Training</h2>
  
  <p class="section-intro">My approach to teaching has been shaped by formal pedagogical training as well as hands-on experience across a range of age groups and settings. I have taught <strong>across the lifespan</strong>—from pre-K and first-grade classrooms to <a href="#dartmouth-ta" style="color: #4169E1; font-weight: 500;">undergraduate students</a> (including <a href="#undergrad-mentorship" style="color: #4169E1; font-weight: 500;">mentoring thesis students</a>) to older adults (ages 50+) in the <a href="#osher-courses" style="color: #4169E1; font-weight: 500;">Osher Lifelong Learning Institute</a>. My experience spans <strong>formal classroom settings, one-on-one mentoring</strong> with high school students, <strong>interactive demonstrations</strong> for young learners, and <strong>discussion-based courses</strong> for retirees. This breadth has taught me to adapt content and teaching style to meet learners where they are, whether explaining brain science through comics about memory for children or exploring cutting-edge research with adult learners eager to engage with complex ideas. My formal training includes coursework through the <strong>Dartmouth Center for Advanced Learning</strong>, as well as training in education policy and socioemotional learning strategies through the <strong>Careers in Education program at UChicago</strong>, supported by the <a href="https://voices.uchicago.edu/successfulpathways/milgrom-community-service-and-innovation-fellowship/" style="color: #4169E1; font-weight: 500;">Milgrom Education Impact Fellowship</a>.</p>

<h3 class="subsection-header" id="undergrad-mentorship">Undergraduate Mentorship</h3>
  <p class="section-intro">I have mentored several undergraduate researchers, including three thesis students across the Cognitive Science, Psychology, and Neuroscience departments, as well as two additional students on formal research projects. My mentees have explored topics including social identity and reappraisal, individual variation in dialogue and conversation, and the relationship between depression and idiosyncratic perception. All three thesis students received fellowships for their work. See my <a href="../Sava_Segal_CV_2.pdf" style="color: #4169E1; font-weight: 500;">CV</a> for more details.</p>

    <div class="course-title">Experience in the Eye of the Beholder: How Individual Brains Create Reality II</div>
    <div class="course-term">Fall 2025</div>
    <div class="course-description">
      This course explores the fascinating world of individual consciousness and subjective experience, examining how each person's unique mental landscape emerges from brain activity. We explore cutting-edge methods scientists use to study the individual brain—from neuroimaging techniques that reveal personal thought patterns to innovative approaches for measuring subjective states like emotions, memories, and perceptions. The course addresses fundamental questions: How do we study something as personal as individual experience? What makes each mind unique?

    <div class="course-description">
      The first version of this course exploring individual consciousness and subjective experience, examining how scientists are beginning to study not just what people are thinking, but how they experience it. This course combines lecture with class discussions and insights from my own research on how people understand the world differently from one another.

    <div class="course-title">Diverse Minds: What We Know and Don't Know About Psychiatric Conditions</div>
    <div class="course-term">Winter 2025</div>
    <div class="course-description">
      This course explores the diversity of the human brain, offering a comprehensive introduction to the complex interactions between brain structure, function, and behavior. The goal is to focus on a broad spectrum of psychiatric conditions (such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder) alongside neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Given the diversity of topics, this is designed as a multi-part series.

    <div class="course-description">
      This course extends the exploration of cognitive neuroscience by examining how we perceive and interpret our surroundings, building on the concepts introduced in the first part. The class introduces the broad landscape of cognitive neuroscience through both readings and hands-on psychological experiments.

    <div class="course-term">Fall 2022, Winter 2023</div>
    <div class="course-description">
      This course explores how the brain supports behaviors such as learning, memory, and processing information. It emphasizes the uniqueness of individual brains and how we each perceive the world differently. The course involves hands-on psychological experiments to illustrate key concepts, starting with the basics of vision and developing into more complex processes like language, emotion, and creativity.

  <h2 class="section-header">Early Childhood Education</h2>
  
  <p class="section-intro">Prior to starting graduate school, I worked and volunteered in early childhood education settings (pre-K and first grade) in Chicago and the Bay Area. As part of this work, I created cartoons to teach cognitive science concepts to children, making complex ideas about how the brain works accessible and engaging for young learners. (I can share them if you really want to see them!)</p>
