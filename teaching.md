### <span>Early Childhood and Education Policy Training</span>

Prior to starting graduate school, I did some work and volunteering in early childhood education (pre-K and high school) in Chicago and in the Bay Area. I also had some more formal education policy training through a program at UChicago. These experiences have shaped my approach to teaching and mentorship across different age groups. See links below.

### <span>Adult Learning Courses</span>

Most recently, I have been designing and teaching courses for adult learners, focusing on cognitive neuroscience and mental health. <a href="https://osher.dartmouth.edu/get_involved/study_leaders/meet_study_leaders/clarasava-segal.php" style="color:rgb(95, 101, 205);">See my recent courses and reviews here.</a>  If you are an Osher student, the class material can be found [here](/osher/DiverseMinds/osher/).

- **<span style="color:rgb(173, 30, 166);">Brain and Behavior: How Are They Linked?</span>** [Fall, Winter, 2023]  
  *Description*: This course explores how the brain supports behaviors such as learning, memory, and processing information. It emphasizes the uniqueness of individual brains and how we each perceive the world differently. The course involves hands-on psychological experiments to illustrate key concepts.

- **<span style="color:rgb(173, 30, 166);">Brain and Behavior Part 2: How Do We Process the World Around Us?</span>** [Spring 2024]  
  *Description*: This course extends the exploration of cognitive neuroscience by examining how we perceive and interpret our surroundings, building on the concepts introduced in the first part.


- **<span style="color:rgb(173, 30, 166);">Diverse Minds: What We Know and Don’t Know About Psychiatric Conditions</span>** [Winter 2025]  
  *Description*: This course explores the diversity of the human brain, offering a comprehensive introduction to the complex interactions between brain structure, function, and behavior. The goal is to focus on a broad spectrum of psychiatric conditions (such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder) alongside neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.
