### <span>Early Childhood and Accessibility Work</span>

Prior to starting graduate school, I worked extensively in early childhood education (pre-K and high school) and engaged deeply with issues of accessibility to higher education. These experiences have shaped my approach to teaching and mentorship across different age groups. See links below.

### <span>Adult Learning Courses</span>

Most recently, I have been designing and teaching courses for adult learners, focusing on cognitive neuroscience and mental health. <a href="https://osher.dartmouth.edu/get_involved/study_leaders/meet_study_leaders/clarasava-segal.php" style="color:rgb(95, 101, 205);">See my recent courses and reviews here.</a>  I will update the syllabi soon.

- **<span style="color:rgb(173, 30, 166);">Brain and Behavior: How Are They Linked?</span>** [Fall, Winter, 2023]  
  *Description*: This course explores how the brain supports behaviors such as learning, memory, and processing information. It emphasizes the uniqueness of individual brains and how we each perceive the world differently. The course involves hands-on psychological experiments to illustrate key concepts.

- **<span style="color:rgb(173, 30, 166);">Brain and Behavior Part 2: How Do We Process the World Around Us?</span>** [Spring 2024]  
  *Description*: This course extends the exploration of cognitive neuroscience by examining how we perceive and interpret our surroundings, building on the concepts introduced in the first part.


- **<span style="color:rgb(173, 30, 166);">Diverse Minds: What We Know and Don’t Know About Psychiatric Conditions</span>** [Winter 2025]  
  *Description*: This course explores the diversity of the human brain, offering a comprehensive introduction to the complex interactions between brain structure, function, and behavior. The goal is to focus on a broad spectrum of psychiatric conditions (such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder) alongside neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.


### <span>Graduate Student Teaching Assistant, Dartmouth College</span>

I have also served as a Teaching Assistant in Dartmouth's Psychological and Brain Sciences Department for the following courses:

- **Fall 2023**: <span style="color:rgb(95, 101, 205);">Introduction to Neuroscience</span>
- **Winter 2023**: <span style="color:rgb(95, 101, 205);">Introduction to Neuroscience</span>
- **Fall 2022**: <span style="color:rgb(95, 101, 205);">Introduction to Neuroscience</span>
- **Spring 2022**: <span style="color:rgb(95, 101, 205);">Psychological Research Methods</span>


### <span>Programs I Recommend</span>

Throughout my academic journey, I have been involved with several educational programs that I highly recommend:

- <a href="https://splashchicago.learningu.org/teach/teachers/clarasavasegal/bio.html" style="color:rgb(95, 101, 205);">Splash</a> -->
<a href="https://www.project-short.com/" style="color:rgb(95, 101, 205);">Project SHORT.</a>
I've had the privilege of mentoring students and helping them navigate the graduate school application process, including building personalized materials. A lot of them can be found here: https://www.project-short.com/resources. 

<a href="https://www.skypeascientist.com/" style="color:rgb(95, 101, 205);">Skype a Scientist.</a>
Through Skype a Scientist, I’ve had the chance to teach interactive classes, bringing neuroscience concepts into classrooms around the world and answering some of the most curious and creative questions from students, which is super fun!

<a href="https://imentor.org/where-we-work/bay-area?gclid=CjwKCAiA4smsBhAEEiwAO6DEjd9mSDIkCQNpaC4q7yf7C9YQeK6SdkQofWxSGqeYRzmLgP4sYiJZTxoCMPkQAvD_BwE" style="color:rgb(95, 101, 205);">iMentor.</a>
As an iMentor participant, I’ve worked closely with high school students, offering guidance and support to help them navigate their academic paths, from choosing colleges to managing school-life balance.

<a href="https://www.jstart.org/" style="color:rgb(95, 101, 205);">Jumpstart.</a>
In my time with Jumpstart, I worked in preschools in Chicago, helping young children in underserved communities develop foundational skills that will support them throughout their educational journey. Great for undergrads!

<a href="https://splashchicago.learningu.org/teach/teachers/clarasavasegal/bio.html" style="color:rgb(95, 101, 205);">Splash.</a>
I've taught fun, hands-on classes through Splash, where high school students can dive into topics they’re passionate about, providing them with a glimpse into the world of neuroscience and psychology. Great for undergrads and post-grads!

Feel free to reach out with any questions about these programs.
