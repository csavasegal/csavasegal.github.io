## Objectives

* Explore how we understand and infer others' inner experiences from a research perspective
* Learn about [some of] the brain regions involved in empathy, perspective-taking, and theory of mind
* Understand how social context shapes subjective experience and vice versa
* Discover tools that allow scientists to study shared mental states
* Reflect on what may lead to miscommunication 
* Reflect on the bigger societal concerns when it comes to studying these things

## The Social Brain: Making Sense of Others

### Discussion Starter

* **How do we know what someone else is thinking or feeling?**
* **Why do some people seem more attuned to others?**

### Key Questions:

1. What are the brain mechanisms that let us "read" minds?
2. Why do misunderstandings happen, even with people we know well?
3. Can technology ever decode or enhance empathy?

- Fantastic demonstration of why subjective experience *matters*:

## Section 1: Mentalizing and Theory of Mind

### Core Concept: We build models of others' minds

* **Theory of Mind (ToM)**: the ability to attribute mental states to others
* **Development**: Emerges around age 4–5 (false belief task)
* **Neural basis**: medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction (TPJ), posterior cingulate cortex

### Demonstration:

* Sally-Anne Test
<img src="/assets/images/osher_lectures/The-Sally-Anne-Task.jpg" alt="Sally Anne Task example" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;" />

### Real-Life Examples:

* Social faux pas, sarcasm, misunderstandings

### Larger relevance:
- **Subjectivity and Interpretation**: Theory of Mind is not just about understanding what others think, but also that others can experience the world differently from us.
- **Constructed Reality**: Our understanding of the world is filtered through our own mental models—and we extend this modeling to others. Cognitive science suggests that we construct mental representations of other people's beliefs, intentions, and emotions, which in turn influence how we interpret events, predict behavior, and assign meaning.
- **Social Reality and Belief Systems**: Shared beliefs (e.g., social norms, institutions, culture) rely on mutual Theory of Mind. We assume others think like we do—or at least that we can model their thinking
 > “The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.”
— Ludwig Wittgenstein
(Theory of Mind may help us imagine beyond those limits.)

## Section 2: Empathy and Emotion Sharing

### Core Concept: We feel what others feel — or think we do

* **Emotional mirroring**: facial mimicry, mirror neurons
  - Embodied cognition: Theories of embodied cognition suggest that we simulate others' experiences using our own sensory and motor systems. Mirror neurons may help us “try on” others’ emotions by triggering internal states that match what we observe.
* **Empathy vs. Sympathy**: Understanding vs. feeling for
* **Suggested Brain areas**: anterior insula, ACC
  - Brain regions like the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are involved in sensing one’s own body and monitoring internal states. 

### Emotion Synchronization:

* Shared physiological responses: heart rate, skin conductance
* Collective emotion in concerts, rituals, protests


---

## Section 3: Miscommunication and Bias

### Core Concept: Our assumptions color our perceptions

* **Egocentric bias**: assuming others see things our way
* **The Curse of Knowledge**: hard to imagine not knowing what you know
* **Cultural differences**: emotion expression norms

### How this relates to our past lectures and discussions:
- **Reality Is Negotiated, Not Given**: According to *Shared Reality Theory*, people are motivated to establish common inner states—beliefs, feelings, attitudes—with others. We seek out and maintain shared realities to reduce uncertainty, foster belonging, and coordinate action. But when assumptions go unchecked, this process can fail.
- **Egocentrism Is the Default**: Even with developed Theory of Mind, we often anchor too strongly in our own knowledge and perspective. This leads to phenomena like the *curse of knowledge* (forgetting what it's like not to know something) and *egocentric bias* (assuming others see what we see), both of which disrupt shared understanding.
- **Miscommunication Erodes Shared Reality**: When we incorrectly assume shared knowledge, misinterpret emotional signals, or ignore context, shared reality breaks down. 

> *The Paradox*: We long to connect and co-construct meaning, yet our minds are wired in ways that often get in the way. Does recognizing these limits help us repair and maintain shared realities more intentionally?

## Section 4: Tools for Studying Shared Experience

### Hyperscanning:

* Recording multiple brains simultaneously (e.g., during conversation)
* Studies show neural synchrony linked to cooperation and understanding

### Naturalistic Paradigms:

* Story listening, music, live interaction
* Neural alignment = shared interpretation

#### Highlighted Study:

## Section 5: Translating Brain to Experience

### Core Concept: Brain activity isn’t the same as experience

<img src="https://www.simplypsychology.org/wp-content/uploads/causation-correlation.jpg" alt="Correlation" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;" />

* **Correlation vs. Causation**: Brain activity that correlates with experience isn’t necessarily causing it
* **The Binding Problem**: How distributed neural signals create unified awareness
* **Individual Differences**: No two brains are wired the same
* **Observer Effect**: Studying consciousness may change it

#### Philosophical Questions:

* Can we truly “read” thoughts?
* Is a brain scan showing a thought or just a pattern?
* How do we bridge the “explanatory gap”?

## Section 6: Ethical Implications of Brain Access

### Mental Privacy in a Neurotech World

![Brain Privacy Concept](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim-Bayne/publication/51164849/figure/fig8/AS:669530071842824@1536642342708/Ethical-considerations-in-consciousness-research.png)

* **Current Capabilities**:

  * Detecting deception with 70–90% accuracy
  * Decoding simple words or images from brain scans
  * Predicting decisions milliseconds before awareness

* **Ethical Dilemmas**:

  1. Should brain scans be allowed in court?
  2. Should employers use brain data to screen employees?
  3. What protections do we need for mental privacy?
  4. How should brain data be used in medicine and law?

### Technologies to Watch:

* **Brain Fingerprinting** — Lie detection
* **Neuromarketing** — Advertising based on brain responses
* **Workplace Surveillance** — Monitoring mental state on the job

#### Discussion Prompts:

1. Would you be comfortable if your brain was monitored at work?
2. If scans predict mental illness, who should know?
3. How does neuroethics shape the future of privacy?

## Section 7: Future of Technology

### Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)

- **Restoring Function**: Thought-controlled robotic limbs, speech decoders, and direct “brain typing” are giving paralyzed patients new ways to interact with the world.

- **Expanding Agency**: BCIs *may* blur the line between thought and action—where does the body end and the interface begin?
    - [blog post](https://medium.com/@monamythreyi/neuro-ai-can-brain-computer-interfaces-blur-the-line-between-thoughts-and-code-14a7ee32904c) on it is linked

- **Redefining Communication**: As decoding brain signals improves, the promise is that our internal states may become directly translatable into action or shared experience.

## The Cognitive Cost of AI: Use It or Lose It?
- Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are reshaping how we write, plan, and even think. But there's a growing concern: Are we offloading too much?

> “The biggest AI threat? Young people who can’t think.”
  — Wall Street Journal (article)[https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-biggest-ai-threat-young-people-who-cant-think-303be1cd]

- Students increasingly rely on AI for language, synthesis, and reasoning. While this can be empowering, overuse may reduce deep processing, critical thinking, and even metacognition.

- Cognitive Offloading is not new (think: calculators, maps, Google). But LLMs may offload the thinking process itself—and with it, our ability to model, reflect, and adapt.

- A 2024 study from MIT ("Your Brain on ChatGPT" (linked here)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1]) was covered broadly by the media and is a good starting point for how to think about these issues

- Do you empower students to learn how to use these tools? Should they even be used in the classroom? Let's discuss!
