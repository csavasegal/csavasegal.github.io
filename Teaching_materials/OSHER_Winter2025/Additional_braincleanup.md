# **Brain "Clean-up" During Sleep: Which Sleep Stage?**

## **Question**
In one session, you mentioned the "clean-up" of toxic waste that occurs in the brain during sleep; during which kind of sleep (REM, Core, Deep) does this occur?

## **Answer**
The **"clean-up" process** in the brain during sleep primarily occurs during **deep sleep** (also called **slow-wave sleep, SWS**). This process is largely facilitated by the **glymphatic system**, a network that helps clear **metabolic waste** from the brain, including **beta-amyloid and tau proteins**, which are linked to neurodegenerative diseases like **Alzheimer’s**.

### **Key Points**
- The **glymphatic system** is most active during **deep sleep (SWS)**.
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows more efficiently during deep sleep, washing away **neurotoxins**.
- Poor deep sleep quality has been associated with an **increased risk of cognitive decline**.

### **Role of Other Sleep Stages**
- **REM Sleep**: Important for memory consolidation but less involved in glymphatic clearance.
- **Core Sleep (Light Sleep, Stage 2)**: Plays a role in memory processing but is not as effective in waste clearance as deep sleep.

### **Implications for Brain Health**
- Ensuring adequate deep sleep may help **reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases**.
- Sleep disorders, aging, and disrupted sleep patterns can impair the glymphatic system’s function.
