Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that significantly impacts movement, cognition, and quality of life, yet its exact cause and mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Research has identified hallmark features, such as the loss of dopamine-producing neurons and the presence of abnormal protein aggregates called Lewy bodies, as well as genetic and environmental risk factors. While advances in treatments, such as deep brain stimulation and improved medications, have enhanced symptom management, no cure exists, and the disease’s progression varies widely among individuals. As new findings emerge, debates persist about redefining Parkinson’s as part of a broader spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing the need to continually reassess and refine our understanding of this complex condition.

## 1. Basic Biology of Movement and Neurotransmission  
- **The Basal Ganglia**:  
   - A group of subcortical brain structures (e.g., striatum, globus pallidus, substantia nigra) involved in motor control.  
   - The **substantia nigra pars compacta** produces **dopamine**, critical for smooth, coordinated movements.  
- **Role of Dopamine**:  
   - Dopamine acts as a neurotransmitter, enabling communication between neurons in the basal ganglia.  
   - Loss of dopamine disrupts motor pathways, leading to PD symptoms.  
- **Neurotransmission in PD**:  
   - **Normal State**: Balanced dopamine activity facilitates motor planning and execution.  
   - **Parkinson's State**: Depletion of dopaminergic neurons causes reduced dopamine release, impairing motor control.

## 2. Introduction to Parkinson's Disease 
- **Definition**: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting movement.  
- **History**:  
   - First described by Dr. James Parkinson in 1817 as "Shaking Palsy." He described six individuals with what he considered a novel condition. His original essay can be found [here](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/jnp.14.2.223).
- **Epidemiology**:  
   - Affects ~1% of people over 60 years old globally.  The global prevalence of Parkinson's disease has been increasing since the 1980s, with a more pronounced rise in the past two decades. The prevalence is higher in more developed countries (Zhu et al., 2024, *The Lancet*)
   - Higher prevalence in males than females.  Men are 1.5 times more likely to have Parkinson's disease than women.
   - Incidence increases with age.  
   - We will discuss why the prevalence may be increasing below

### **What We Know**  
- PD is caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.  
- The disease affects the motor system and eventually leads to non-motor complications.  

### **What We Don’t Know**  
- The exact cause of PD remains unclear: Is it primarily genetic, environmental, or a combination?  
- Why do some individuals develop PD while others do not, even with similar risk factors?

## 3. Neurobiology and Pathology of PD  
- **Key Brain Areas Involved**:  
   - Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the **substantia nigra pars compacta**.  
   - Reduced dopamine levels in the **striatum** (part of the basal ganglia).  
- **Role of Dopamine**:  
   - Dopamine regulates smooth, purposeful movements.  
- **Pathological Features**:  
   - Presence of **Lewy bodies**: abnormal protein deposits  
   - Neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction.  
- **Key Concept**: Loss of ~70-80% of dopaminergic neurons before motor symptoms appear.

### **Mechanisms of dopamine release that can go awry**
Dopamine release, which is critical for brain function, is often disrupted early. Here’s how it can go wrong:

- **Problems with Releasing Dopamine**:
   - Dopamine is released through a process that depends on specific proteins (SNARE) and energy from mitochondria. In PD, genetic mutations and toxic proteins like α-synuclein disrupt these processes, making it harder for dopamine to be released.
- **Trouble Loading Dopamine into Vesicles**:
   - Dopamine needs to be stored in tiny sacs (called synaptic vesicles) before it can be released. In PD, issues with vesicle loading or moving them to the right place reduce the amount of dopamine available.
- **Recycling Problems**:
   - After dopamine is released, vesicles and leftover dopamine are supposed to be recycled for future use. Mutations in PD interfere with this recycling process, leading to shortages.
- **Damage to Dopamine Storage**:
   - Stress from harmful molecules like reactive oxygen species (ROS) damages the vesicles that store dopamine. This can cause dopamine to leak out and create toxic byproducts, further harming the cell.
- **Protein Build-Up**:
   - PD often involves the build-up of proteins like α-synuclein. These clumps can block important cell functions or trap useful proteins, making it harder for the cell to release dopamine.
- **Signals from Other Cells**:
   - Dopamine release is also influenced by signals from surrounding cells. In PD, changes in these signals—like increased inhibition from GABA, another neurotransmitter—can reduce dopamine release.



### **What We Know**  
- Lewy bodies and alpha-synuclein accumulation are central to PD pathology.  
- Dopamine loss drives the motor symptoms of PD.  

### **What We Don’t Know**  
- What triggers alpha-synuclein aggregation? Is it a cause or a consequence of PD?  
- Why does PD pathology spread to other regions beyond the substantia nigra (e.g., brainstem, cortex)?

## 4. Clinical Symptoms and Diagnosis  
- **Motor Symptoms** (Cardinal Features - "TRAP"):  
   1. **Tremor**: Resting tremor, "pill-rolling" motion.  
   2. **Rigidity**: Muscle stiffness, "cogwheel rigidity."  
   3. **Akinesia/Bradykinesia**: Slowness or absence of movement.  
   4. **Postural Instability**: Balance and gait disturbances.  
- **Non-Motor Symptoms**:  
   - Cognitive decline, depression, sleep disorders, constipation, hyposmia (loss of smell).  
- **Clinical Diagnosis**:  
   - Based on history and physical examination.  
   - No definitive lab test; imaging (e.g., DaTscan) aids diagnosis in atypical cases.  
- **Hoehn and Yahr Staging**:  
   - Stage 1: Unilateral symptoms.  
   - Stage 2: Bilateral symptoms, no balance impairment.  
   - Stage 3: Balance impairment, mild to moderate disability.  
   - Stage 4: Severe disability; still able to walk/stand.  
   - Stage 5: Wheelchair/bed-bound.

- This image was taken from this [blog post](https://www.parkinsonsecrets.com/blog/what-is-coming-in-2024-for-parkinsons-biological-definitions-staging-and-classification). It appears that a basic concern modern neurologists have with this scale is that it doesn't account for motor and non-motor  symptoms and doesn't capture the functional status of the person. However, it is widely used across clinics and also used for billing purposes (or so I've seen).




### **What We Know**  
- PD diagnosis relies on clinical symptoms, primarily motor signs.  
- Early diagnosis can improve quality of life with timely intervention.  

### **What We Don’t Know**  
- How to reliably detect PD before symptoms appear.  
- How non-motor symptoms relate to the progression of the disease.

## 5. Treatment Options  

### A. Pharmacological Treatments  
- **Levodopa (L-DOPA)**:  
   - The gold standard for motor symptom relief.  
   - Often combined with **Carbidopa** (to prevent peripheral metabolism).  
      - Levodopa is the most effective treatment for Parkinson’s motor symptoms. It works by turning into dopamine in the brain, which helps replace the dopamine that’s missing.
      - Carbidopa is often added to stop Levodopa from being broken down before it reaches the brain, ensuring more of it gets where it’s needed.
- **Dopamine Agonists**:  
   - E.g., Pramipexole, Ropinirole.  
   - Mimic dopamine’s effect on the brain.
      - Drugs like Pramipexole and Ropinirole act like dopamine in the brain. They "trick" dopamine receptors into thinking they’re getting dopamine, which helps improve movement and reduce stiffness.
      - These drugs can be used alone or with Levodopa.  
- **MAO-B Inhibitors**:  
   - E.g., Selegiline, Rasagiline.  
   - Prevent dopamine breakdown.  
      - Examples include Selegiline and Rasagiline. These medications block an enzyme called MAO-B, which normally breaks down dopamine in the brain. By preventing this breakdown, the brain keeps more dopamine around for longer, which helps with movement.
- **COMT Inhibitors**:  
   - E.g., Entacapone.  
   - Extend Levodopa's duration.  
      - Drugs like Entacapone help Levodopa work longer. They block another enzyme (COMT) that breaks down Levodopa before it turns into dopamine, ensuring it stays active for a longer time and reduces "off" periods when symptoms return.
- **Anticholinergics**: Useful for tremor in younger patients.  
   - These drugs, such as Benztropine, help control tremors, especially in younger patients. They work by blocking a chemical called acetylcholine, which helps balance the brain’s signaling systems when dopamine levels are low. 

### B. Non-Pharmacological Treatments  
- **Physical Therapy**:  
   - Focus on balance, strength, and flexibility.  
- **Speech Therapy**: Addresses hypophonia and swallowing issues.  
- **Occupational Therapy**: Helps with daily activities.  
- **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)**:  
   - Surgical option for advanced cases unresponsive to medication.  

### **What We Know**  
- Current treatments target symptoms but do not stop or reverse neurodegeneration.  
- Combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies improves outcomes.  

### **What We Don’t Know**  
- Why treatments work better for some patients than others.  
- How to develop disease-modifying therapies that stop progression.

## 6. Current Research and Future Directions  

### Areas of Active Research:  
- **Pathogenesis**: Investigating the role of alpha-synuclein, genetics, and environmental triggers.  
- **Biomarkers**: Efforts to identify early diagnostic biomarkers (e.g., CSF alpha-synuclein).  
- **Neuroprotective Strategies**: Trials focusing on slowing neurodegeneration.  
- **Gene Therapy**: Potential to deliver neuroprotective proteins or enzymes.  
- **Stem Cell Research**: Developing dopaminergic neurons for cell transplantation.  

### **What We Know**  
- Genetic mutations (e.g., LRRK2, SNCA) are associated with PD in some patients.  
- Environmental factors like pesticides may contribute to PD risk.  

### **What We Don’t Know**  
- How gene-environment interactions trigger PD- see next section.  
- How to translate promising animal model research into effective human therapies.

## 7. Risk Factors
- Why is the prevalence of PD increasing? A lot of the ideas in this section are discussed in the paper sent out: [Dorsey & Bloem, 2024](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JPD-230357#ref005)
- *Better Diagnosis?*: One common explanation for the rise in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is that increased awareness and improved diagnostic tools have led to higher detection rates over time. While this may hold some truth, it can only account for the relative increase in PD if these factors are more relevant to PD than to other neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis or stroke. 
- *Increased aging?*: PD rates have risen both in absolute numbers and when adjusted for age (GBD 2016 Parkinson’s Disease Collaborators, 2018). In contrast, while global Alzheimer’s disease prevalence more than doubled in absolute terms from 1990 to 2016, age-adjusted rates have remained relatively stable. This suggests that factors beyond aging alone are driving the rise in PD cases.

- *Sex?*:  Sociological rather than biological factors may contribute to sex differences in PD prevalence. For instance, in regions where men are more likely to be exposed to environmental toxicants like pesticides, PD is more common in men. Conversely, in areas where women are more frequently exposed to pesticides (e.g., through farming), PD is more prevalent among women (idea from Dorsey & Bloem, 2024). (Note for class: This is an example of correlation, not causation!)

- *Exposure to toxins*: Gene-environment relationships have been well-documented to play an important role. Several pesticides that have been linked to PD (e.g., paraquat, rotenone). These contaminants may extend to cleaning supplies, food, the stool of those ingesting them, water contamination, etc. 

### Air pollution, pesticides, and TCE (trichloroethylene) share several characteristics that may link them to Parkinson's disease (PD):

<ol>

<li>
<strong>Mitochondrial Toxicity</strong>:
These substances are toxic to mitochondria, which play a critical role in energy production, particularly in the brain—a highly energy-dependent organ. Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which are especially energy-demanding due to their extensive axon networks and synapses, are particularly vulnerable. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also central to genetic causes of PD (e.g., LRRK2, Parkin, SNCA), suggesting a shared mechanism that bridges genetic and environmental factors.

        alt="This is an image of a mitochondria." 
        style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px; height: auto;" />
</a>

<li><strong>Inhalation Pathways</strong>:
These toxicants can enter the body through inhalation, bypassing protective barriers like the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver.They can reach the olfactory bulb directly, a region associated with early PD pathology and symptoms such as loss of smell (hyposmia), which is common in PD. This "nose-to-brain" pathway may explain how environmental exposures initiate early PD-related changes in the brain.
</li>

<li><strong>Modern Environmental Origins</strong>:

Large-scale air pollution, synthetic pesticides, and commercial TCE use are relatively recent phenomena, tied to industrialization and the post-World War II era. While natural toxins like rotenone have existed for centuries and may explain older cases of PD, the sharp global rise in PD aligns with increased exposure to modern environmental toxicants.
