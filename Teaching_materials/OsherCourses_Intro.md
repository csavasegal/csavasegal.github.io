### Course Description
*This course explores the diversity of the human brain, offering a comprehensive introduction to the complex interactions between brain structure, function, and behavior. The goal is to focus on a broad spectrum of psychiatric conditions (such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder) alongside neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. The course will dive into what modern neuroscience and psychiatry have uncovered about these conditions, as well as the gaps that remain in our understanding. Given this diversity of topics, we expect this to be a multiple-part series.*
